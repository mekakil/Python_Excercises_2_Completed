TypeError:

How to fix:

In looking for fixing the error by the internet, I got to understand that there is a transparent space in some softwares or bugs. Sometime, the IDLE will be handy for discovery and run or even other running on programiz.com.
A clear explanation is that the softwares inclusive not are configure for the use of ''tab'', for instance,
We can resolve this issue on software Atom by Packages > Whitespace >Â  Convert Spaces to Tabs.




Bellow the code fixed:


def my_function(y, x):
# Age permitted is above 16.
# Hight permitted is above 1.60.
# Supervisor is called when: age equal 11 and hight is equal or greater than 1.50.
# Supervisor is called when: age is equal or greater than 11 and hight equal or less than 1.60.
# Age equal 11, is considerable acceptable if hight sastify the supervisor anaylsis.
# Hight between 1.50 to 1.59, is considerable acceptable if the minimum age of 11, but dependes od suspervisor decisions (analysis).

	age = y
	h = x
	if age <= 10 or h <= 1.49:
		print(age, h)
		print("disapproved")
	if age == 11 and h >= 1.50:
            print("Supervisor")
	if age >= 11 and h <= 1.60:
            print("Supervisor")
	if age >= 12 and h >= 1.60:
		print(age, h)
		print("approved")

print(my_function(12, 1.50))
